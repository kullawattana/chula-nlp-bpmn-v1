In November of each year, the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a schedule of meetings for the next calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars.
The Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications.
The Coordination Unit then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts.
The final schedule of meeting dates is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email, who then check their diaries and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts.
Once the dates are finalized (by the Coordination Unit), the Support Officer updates all group calendars and creates meeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system.
Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related documents.
The Committee Members hold their meeting, and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member.
Within 5 working days, the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes, which are then sent to all Committee Members.
The Support Officer then updates all departmental records.

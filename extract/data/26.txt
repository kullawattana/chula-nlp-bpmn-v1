The Office Supply Request Process starts when an employee of the organization submits an office supply request.
Once the requirement is registered, the request is received by the immediate supervisor.
the supervisor must approve, request changes or reject the request.
If the request is rejected the Process will end.
If the request requires changes it is returned to the employee (requester) who can review the comments and change it.
If the request is approved, it will go to the Purchase Department in charge of quoting and selecting a vendor.
If the vendor is not valid in the system, the Purchase Department will have to choose a different vendor.
After a vendor is selected and confirmed, the system will wait for the products to be delivered and the invoice received.
The system will then send a notification to the employee informing the outcome.

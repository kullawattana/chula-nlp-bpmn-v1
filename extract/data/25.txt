The Vacation Request Process starts when an employee of the organization submits a vacation request.
Once the requirement is registered, the request is received by the immediate supervisor; the supervisor must approve or reject the request.
If the request is rejected the application is returned to the applicant/employee who can review the rejection reasons.
If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources representative, who must complete the respective administrative procedures.
